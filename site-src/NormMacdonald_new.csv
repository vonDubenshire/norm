A Tribute to Norm Macdonald,"Norm Macdonald is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians to ever walk the face of the planet. He is my absolute favorite comedian for so many reasons I couldn't  list them all if I tried. A few reasons that stand out are his absolutely masterful comedic timing and delivery, his intelligent and carefully-crafted observations, and his ability to be honest in a world full of deception. Norm Macdonald is undoubtedly a comedian's comedian. He was known in the mainstream for being on Billy Madison and Saturday Night Live, but aside from that his stand up and late night appearances really solidified why his comedic voice stood out from the rest. Louis C.K described Norm Macdonald as the closest comedian to Mark Twain because of his voice, and ability. Another thing I absolutely adored about Norm's comedy was the simplicity of his style. He would deliver things that everyone has observed before, but he'd do it in a humble manner that would catch you off-guard and make you laugh endlessly. There are often comedians that can be grouped together for a certain genre or style, but for Norm there is simply no comedian like him. He was truly an enigma because of his comedic voice, and there will never be another person like him. Norm left behind a legacy that no fan will ever forget. He's been an inspiration to many seasoned comedians and also young comedians like myself. I aspire to one day be able to do something similar to what this amazing man did on stage. The world of stand-up comedy is a slightly darker place without Norm Macdonald. I hope you guys enjoyed this tribute video. God Bless Norm Macdonald, may he rest in peace.
