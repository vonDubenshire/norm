    "Title": "A Tribute to Norm Macdonald",
    "Description": "Norm Macdonald is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians to ever walk the face of the planet. He is my absolute favorite comedian for so many reasons I couldn't  list them all if I tried. A few reasons that stand out are his absolutely masterful comedic timing and delivery, his intelligent and carefully-crafted observations, and his ability to be honest in a world full of deception. Norm Macdonald is undoubtedly a comedian's comedian. He was known in the mainstream for being on Billy Madison and Saturday Night Live, but aside from that his stand up and late night appearances really solidified why his comedic voice stood out from the rest. Louis C.K described Norm Macdonald as the closest comedian to Mark Twain because of his voice, and ability. Another thing I absolutely adored about Norm's comedy was the simplicity of his style. He would deliver things that everyone has observed before, but he'd do it in a humble manner that would catch you off-guard and make you laugh endlessly. There are often comedians that can be grouped together for a certain genre or style, but for Norm there is simply no comedian like him. He was truly an enigma because of his comedic voice, and there will never be another person like him. Norm left behind a legacy that no fan will ever forget. He's been an inspiration to many seasoned comedians and also young comedians like myself. I aspire to one day be able to do something similar to what this amazing man did on stage. The world of stand-up comedy is a slightly darker place without Norm Macdonald. I hope you guys enjoyed this tribute video. God Bless Norm Macdonald, may he rest in peace.\n\n\"It's one thing to make people laugh, it's another to make people smile.\"\n- Norm Macdonald",

But before that, Dennis' joke was pretty good, pretty raunchy.\n\nRest in peace, Norm Macdonald (1959-2021).\n\n#normmacdonald #chevychase #dennismiller",

    "Description": "David Letterman and Conan O'Brien, Part 2: 2010-2012\nSeptember 13, 2018, marks Conan O'Brien's 25th year on late night television. Here's a two-part Dave/Conan compilation to commemorate the milestone.\n\nPart 1 documents Dave's and Conan's interactions on each other's shows from 1994 to 1999, followed by Dave's reactions when Conan was awarded The Tonight Show in 2004 and then finally took over the show in 2009. Part 1 is here: https://youtu.be/aAcOHwtq__E\n\nIn the absence of further appearances, Part 2 is devoted mostly to Dave's gags and running commentary on the fiasco that was The Tonight Show in January 2010. The collection ends with Conan's last Late Show guest appearance in 2012.\n\nPart 2\nJanuary 2010: The bird network cancels Jay Leno's nightly 10 PM show and suggests he host a half-hour at 11:35 PM before Conan's Tonight Show. Conan is not pleased. The ruckus gives Dave material for the next two weeks:\n18. January 11, 2010. Dave on Conan vs. Jay, 1: Dave's Plan\n19. January 12, 2010.

He was named among the 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time by Comedy Central. During this time he became famous for his sardonic and often scathingly ironic comments and insults for which he was loved and hated equally by his fans and detractors.\n*Artie Lange is an American comedian, podcaster, actor and author, best known for his appearances on popular comedy shows such as Mad TV and The Howard Stern Show.Suffering from drugs and alcohol abuse damaged his career in a big way, but he managed to earn some success with his stand-up comedy shows and the books that he wrote about his life experiences. In 2019, he began a podcast named Artie Langeâ€™s Halfway House, which he stopped in 2020 owing to health issues.\n\n********************************\nHoward Allan Stern is a well-known American radio jockey, television host, actor, and author. He started his career as a marketing executive and later worked as a radio salesman, from where he worked his way up to midday shifts at a radio station, eventually becoming the station’s production director. He has worked with a number of radio stations that include WWWW, WWDC, WNBC, and WXRK. \nHe became a national sensation when his show ‘The Howard Stern Show’ gained popularity throughout America. The show, which was first aired in 1986, had a tremendous run until it was finally taken off air in 2005. During its run, ‘The Howard Stern Show’ had gained a whopping 20 million listeners and was aired across 60 markets. Howard is also well-known for his television shows, such as ‘The Howard Stern Show’ and ‘The Howard Stern Interview.’ \nHis book ‘Private Parts’ became a bestseller and was later adapted into a movie in which he appeared as himself. Stern is known by his self-proclaimed title ‘King of all Media,’ for his contribution across all major entertainment platforms has been immense over the years.\n#howardstern",

It's an edit of our favorite moments, including all of Norm's digressions, many of which the network had no use for.  But they all worked, and in front of a typical game show audience. Just as he was great on a wide range of talk shows, Norm could make anyone laugh if given the chance.\nExec Produced by Robert Smigel writing with Eric Slovin, Leo Allen and David Feldman.

    "Description": "00:00\n00:27\nWell, we’re here to look back on the year that was, and all the different crazy things that happened during the year. And, uh, uh, I didn’t catch a lot of it. \n\n00:40\nSo, of course we all know that there’s an election, ya know? Big election. And it was a very important election, probably our most important election. And people had very strong opinions on the election, ya know? Some people had very strong opinions one way, and other people had strong opinions the other way. And uh… I didn’t have any opinions at all. Uh, I don’t have really any opinions on anything. Like, you ever watch the CNN, and they’ll have the polls, ya know? They’ll be like, “What do you think about embryonic stem cell research?” And then they’ll be like, see there ya go. They’ll be like, “52% yes. 46% no. 6% I don’t know.” See: and that’s me; I don’t know.\n\n01:48\nSo I phoned up the CNN, ya know, and I go, “Hey, uh, listen, is this the TV? Uh, yeah that question you asked about the embryonic stem cell research?: I dunno know.” But now you know you should… I admire people who have strong opinions, ya know, like Linda Ronstadt. She did that thing, ya know, where she was, got up and sang and everything, and then she started talking. And then, people were going, “God damn, I thought she was supposed to sing?” And uh, and she just kept talking and finally they were like, “Come on man, sing those only two songs we ever heard you sing! …Return that $45 ticket I’m holding here.”\n\n02:36\nAnd, ya know, celebrities have, uh, uh, they can speak up, ya know? They’re, they’re smart, ya know? Some of them. Most of ‘em are, are, are dumb, but some of them… Because I meet celebrities; I’m a celebrity… ehhh… and uh, and so I can, I meet celebrities, and I know as soon as I shake their hand, I know, “Hey, there’s a dumb guy,” ya know I uh, because I’m a dumb guy myself, and I’ve got that, ya know how gay guys have the gay-dar? I’m like that with dumb people. I’m like, “Hey, how’s it going? Hey I can have a conversation with you, man.”\n\n3:21\nSo hey at the end of the election, ya know, there was trouble for the both candidates ‘cause they had the undecideds like me: who didn’t know. And so they were trying their hardest to get us to know. But, ya know, we’re all dumb; we didn’t know. And then they decided to go with commercials where they just had some animals in them. Ya know? Like, I remember one that was a bunch of wolves! Ya know, and uh, and then the narrator he goes, “Hey! Do you want a bunch of wolves to eat you?” You’re like, “God damn, no, that’s a bad… that’s the last thing I want.” And then the other character he came out with his own, ‘cause the wolf thing was working good, and so his was, he goes, “Would you rather be a ostrich… or a eagle?” And you’re like, “Yeah, that’s a tough one there…” And the guy’s like, “You’d rather be an eagle, you retard!” “I would?” “Yes! ‘Cause then the wolf can’t jump up as high and uh, to catch ya!” So you’re like, alright, alright!\n\n04:40\nI’ll tell you what I do like in the news. The big murder trials, ya know, ‘cause I can follow that, ya know? And now, they have the greatest one that’s coming up, ya know, ‘cause the best ones when celebrities are up for murder ‘cause then you know the guy, ya know? And uh, so, right? So, uh, they selected the jurors for the Robert Blake trial, so that will move on, and I’m happy about that, ‘cause I love Robert Blake. Ever since I was a kid, watched him, “Beretta” my favorite show, God damn that was a good show. I will say one thing about Robert Blake, the guy appears to have, uh, uh, not the greatest alibi I’ve ever heard. Seems to be a relatively weak alibi, to me, ya know? And I’m no, jurisprudence, ya, I dunno… But uh, this is his alibi as far as I can figure out, he goes, “It couldn’t have been me who uh, shot my wife in the secluded area over by the side of the ditch on account of I have an alibi.” “Oh where were ya?” “I had to go back to the restaurant. I forgot my gun. Then I got my gun, I went back to where my wife is, and God damn, somebody shot her.” Now, so I don’t know what alibis he discarded before he decided to go with that one but… \n\n06:20\nSee, this is the thing with celebrity trials, ya know, is that it really gets the country all worked up because the last celebrity murder of course we had was the O.J. Simpson murder. And what happened there is, O.J. Simpson was uh, uh, acquitted of murder, ya know? And then all the black people thought that O.J. was innocent, and all the white people thought that O.J. was guilty. So, what happened was it created a racial divide in the country… I read that in a magazine. It created, uh, but what that means is of course the races were divided, ya know? And that’s no good. Ya know? So I was thinking, I was figuring, maybe uh, what do you think of this? Maybe we let Robert Blake off, and call it even? And then…\n\n07:22\nAlright folks, well God bless you all and God bless America.",

    "Title": "Norm Macdonald & Artie Lange Playing Poker",
    "Description": "Norm Macdonald is a Canadian stand-up comedian, writer, producer and actor. He is best known for his five seasons as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, which included anchoring Weekend Update for three years. Early in his career, he wrote for the sitcom Roseanne and made appearances on shows including The Drew Carey Show and NewsRadio. He starred in The Norm Show from 1999 to 2001. Comedy Central named him #83 on the five-part miniseries 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. He is noted as a favorite talk show guest of David Letterman, Howard Stern, Dennis Miller, and Conan O'Brien. His brother is Canadian journalist Neil Macdonald, of CBC News\nArtie Lange is an American comedian, actor, author and radio show host, best known for his tenures on The Howard Stern Show and the sketch comedy series Mad TV. Born and raised in New Jersey, Lange first worked as a longshoreman and cab driver to help support his family following the death of his quadriplegic father. After making his stand-up debut in 1987, he began a full-time comedy career in 1992, performing stand-up and improv shows throughout the New York City area.\n\nIn 1995, Lange moved to Los Angeles to star in the first season of Mad TV before his arrest for cocaine possession caused his departure during the second season in 1997. After rehabilitation, Norm Macdonald chose Lange to star in his comedy film Dirty Work (1998) which secured Lange additional film roles and, from 1999 to 2001, a place on Macdonald's sitcom, The Norm Show. Lange returned to New York City to join The Howard Stern Show in 2001 which lasted for eight years. He pursued various projects during this time; he released the comedy albums It's the Whiskey Talkin' (2004) and Jack and Coke (2009), co-wrote, produced, and starred in his feature film Artie Lange's Beer League (2006), and co-wrote his first memoir, Too Fat to Fish (2008), which entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number one. Lange left the show in January 2010 following a suicide attempt from a heroin addiction.\n\nLange resumed his career in 2011 as the co-host of a radio show with Nick DiPaolo named The Nick & Artie Show. After DiPaolo left in 2013, it was renamed The Artie Lange Show which lasted until April 2014. Lange co-wrote a second book during this time, Crash and Burn (2013). Lange started his podcast, The Artie Quitter Podcast, in January 2015 and continues to perform comedy and act in various capacities. His third book is set for release in 2017.\nMacdonald was a guest character on My Name Is Earl in the episode \"Two Balls, Two Strikes\" as \"Lil Chubby\", the son of \"Chubby\" (played by Burt Reynolds), similar to Macdonald's portrayals of Reynolds on SNL. In September 2010, it was reported that Macdonald was developing a new series for Comedy Central that he described as a sports version of The Daily Show.[21] As of April 2011, the show was titled Sports Show with Norm Macdonald and premiered on April 12 on Comedy Central.[22] The Sports Show was not renewed, reportedly due to low ratings, after all nine ordered episodes were broadcast. Macdonald's first stand-up special, Me Doing Stand-Up, aired on Comedy Central on March 26.[23] On May 23, 2011 Comedy Central announced the release an audio CD and DVD of the special on June 14 on Comedy Central Records, and Home Entertainment.[24] It was also made available as a digital download. Both releases contain uncensored and unseen material from the special, and the DVD special features include the sitcom pilot Back To Norm, an animated featurette The Twelve Days Of Christmas, and Macdonald's appearance on The Comedy Central Roast of Bob Saget.[25]\n\nOn February 26, 2011, he became a commentator and co-host (with Kara Scott) of the seventh season of the TV series High Stakes Poker on Game Show Network. He hosted Sports Show with Norm Macdonald on Comedy Central, which began airing on April 12, 2011.\nMacdonald says his influences include Bob Newhart,[38] Leo Tolstoy, Bob Hope, Sam Kinison, and Dennis Miller. Speaking about Canada's homegrown comedy industry, Macdonald reflected that he would have liked there to have been more opportunity for him to stay in the country early in his career, stating:\nSubscribe for new videos coming soon !",

    "Description": "Norm Macdonald’s been dubbed a comedic genius for his subversive brand of comedy, but penning his forthcoming memoir reminded him that he’s had “no education.”\n\n“The scariest [part about writing a book] is I have no education and so I really feel like to be a good writer, you need education,” the comedian, who never graduated high school, told Page Six on Thursday after hosting “Gotham Comedy Live.” “My son has [an] education. He’s a much better writer than I am, and he’s only 20.”\n\nStarting from when Macdonald was born in Quebec City, Canada, and spanning his storied career — writing for “Roseanne,” appearing on “The Drew Carey Show,” becoming a household name as an anchor on “Weekend Update” on “Saturday Night Live” to ultimately being fired in 1998 from the Lorne Michaels-created show — the 52-year-old certainly has plenty of material to work with.\n\n“I’ve never worked so hard. It was very hard for me to keep a whole book in my head. I could keep a sketch in my head or even a movie … but a book. It’s so hard to keep that whole thing at once in your head,” he explained.\n\n‘[I] feel like I’m losing my mind when I’m writing.’\n - Norm Macdonald\n“If you like a good old-fashioned tell-all bombshell about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll, and if you like an unflinching account of how the dirty little business of big-time comedy works, then you will love ‘Based On A True Story,’” Macdonald wrote in the publisher’s announcement last December.\n\n“OK, one time I do flinch. But only once. The rest of the time, unflinching. Also, there will be no mention of rock ’n’ roll. I was lying.”\n\nThe 250-page, 100,000-word book was “supposed to take a year” to pen, but it “took five years,” Macdonald revealed. “I’d read it and then as soon as I read it, rewrite it. Read it, rewrite it. Read it, rewrite it.”\n\nBut for someone who struggled with telling his own story, Macdonald’s found solace in the work of the greats.\n\n“I just read the Russians. I don’t read anything modern. I haven’t read anything modern ever in my life. People try to turn me on to stuff and I go, ‘Well, I don’t know,’” he said. “If it’s happy, you call it classic. They call it classic if it’s around for a couple hundred years, so I’ve gotta catch up. It’s going to take me my whole life.”\n\nJack and Jill \nFunbucket\n 2011 Hollywood & Wine\n 2010 Grown Ups \n 2009 Funny People \n 2007-2009 My Name Is Earl\nLittle Chubby\n 2008 The Flight Before Christmas \nJulius (English version, voice)\n 2008 Senior Skip Day (Video) \nMr. Rigetti\n 2008 Dr. Dolittle: Tail to the Chief (Video) \nLucky (voice, uncredited)\n 2007 Christmas Is Here Again (Video) \nBuster (voice)\n 2006 The Fairly OddParents in Fairy Idol (TV Movie) \nGenie (as Norm McDonald)\n 2006 Dr. Dolittle 3 (Video) \nLucky (voice, uncredited)\n 2006 Farce of the Penguins \nJoin Twosomes Penguin (voice)\n 2005 Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo \nEarl McManus (uncredited)\n 2005 Back to Norm (TV Movie) \nVarious\n 2005 The Fairly OddParents (TV Series) \nNorm the Genie\nStan Hooper\n 2004 Oliver Beene (TV Series) \nHobo Bob\n- Girly Dad (2004) ...

    "Description": "A video about Norm, his incident in Iowa, his philosophies, and the things he kept quiet. I tried to communicate what I enjoy about Norm into this.\n\nHopefully I didn't misrepresent any of his thoughts or events, just trying to spread Norm far and wide and add to all the awesome content out there, and hopefully introduce more people to him.\n\nThanks for watching and thanks to r/NormMacdonald which led me to many useful links/articles/clips. \n\nApologies if you experience incessant ads, a music label is controlling this entire video for a 15s song clip I used. Learned my lesson.\n\nRevisions:\n-On graduating at 14…someone brought up a good point I didn’t put together. Norm used to lie about his age haha so it’s possible graduating at 14 was just a confusion with his actual birthdate. Hard to find anything on this. I saw somewhere else that he reportedly “skipped the last two years” of HS (and Norm would always lie and tell people he dropped out.)\n-It’s possible Regis was genuinely concerned about Norm potentially “losing” the $500,000 for charity. Reportedly Regis doesn’t know the answers beforehand so idk.\n-(typo) Comedian Lara Ray should be “Lara Rae”\n\n.....\nPodcast episode sources:\nWTF Marc Maron: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6c4O2B2L1V6OMgzDHh1Vua\nComedy Album Bookclub: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6fpZUV08br5vpQPdJnQ0Lz\nTheo Von/Jim Breuer (Iowa Story): https://open.spotify.com/episode/18GDB8paYnHA8h7IYTeVka\nConan O'Brien: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1PRdqcSkRnZuYpznfIubu4\n\nAll 45 Full Norm Macdonald Live Video Podcast episodes are available for free viewing/download on the Internet Archive, there's a real jerk of a channel on YouTube is trying to charge people for them: https://archive.org/details/Norm_Macdonald_Live\n\nI uploaded all the newspaper clippings I found using a newspaper archive site here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1schs3Ouhg8Xhm3OWJHhgB2fYU3EcxBsR?usp=sharing\n\n#normmacdonald",

But there are no other recordings of it to my knowledge, and the world is so desperate for laughs- especially today, after Norm's untimely passing. It feels appropriate to share now.  \n\nLive at a crowded table near the stage, at the once great Brea Improv, in Brea California.  This was Norm at the end of his brilliant 4 decade comedy run. Still in the sunset of his prime.  In 2018, when real stand up comedy was still allowed and at it's peak. Many straight-forward, unpredictable and indirect comic geniuses have roamed this Earth, but Norm was the best.",

    "Title": "Norm Macdonald Talking with Three Hot Women on Morning Show in Utah #SexCrimes",
    "Description": "Get The Brave Browser and get paid for browsing the web\nhttps://brave.com/urs419\n\nNorman Gene \"Norm\" Macdonald is a Canadian stand-up comedian, writer, producer and actor. He is best known for his five seasons as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, which included anchoring Weekend Update for three years. Early in his career, he wrote for the sitcom Roseanne and made appearances on shows including The Drew Carey Show and NewsRadio. He starred in The Norm Show from 1999 to 2001. Comedy Central named him #83 on the five-part miniseries 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. He is noted as a favorite talk show guest of David Letterman, Howard Stern, Dennis Miller, and Conan O'Brien. His brother is Canadian journalist Neil Macdonald, of CBC News.[3][4]\n\nMacdonald was born in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada,[2] and raised in Ottawa, Ontario.[citation needed] Macdonald has a brother, Neil Macdonald, who is a journalist with the CBC.[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\nMacdonald's first performances in comedy were at stand-up at clubs in Ottawa. He appeared at the 1987 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal.[5]\n\nSaturday Night Live[edit]\nMacdonald joined the cast of NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) television program in 1993, where he performed impressions of Larry King, Burt Reynolds, David Letterman, Charles Kuralt and Bob Dole, among others. Following Kevin Nealon's departure from SNL, Macdonald anchored the segment Weekend Update. Chevy Chase, the first anchor of Weekend Update, has quipped that Macdonald was the \"best Weekend Update anchor since – well – Chevy Chase\".[6] Current Update anchor and head writer Colin Jost named Macdonald as a primary influence on Jost's own work behind the \"Update\" desk, explaining that Macdonald's tone was one that Jost grew up with in high school.[7]\n\nMacdonald's version of Weekend Update often included repeated references to prison rape, crack whores and the Germans' love of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. Macdonald would occasionally deliver a piece of news, then take out his personal compact tape recorder and leave a \"note to self\" relevant to what he just discussed. He commonly used Frank Stallone as a non sequitur punchline. Macdonald repeatedly ridiculed public figures such as Marion Barry, Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson. Throughout Simpson's trial for murder, Macdonald constantly pilloried the former football star, often heavily implying Simpson was guilty of the brutal slaying of his wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman. In the broadcast following Simpson's acquittal, Macdonald opened Weekend Update by saying: \"Well, it is finally official: murder is legal in the state of California.\"\n\nDuring the February 24, 1996, episode, Macdonald made a controversial joke about the sentencing of John Lotter, one of the two men who committed the notorious murder of Brandon Teena: \"In Falls City, Nebraska, John Lotter has been sentenced to death for attempting to kill three people in what prosecutors called a plot to silence a cross-dressing female who had accused him of rape. Now this might strike some viewers as harsh, but I believe everyone involved in this story deserved to die.\"[8][9]\n\nAfter the announcement that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley planned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences on Weekend Update: \"She's more of a stay-at-home type, and he's more of a homosexual pedophile.\" He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singer's collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report of how Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs of Shirley Temple, Macdonald remarked that viewers should not get the wrong idea, adding, \"Michael Jackson is a homosexual pedophile.\" The joke elicited audible gasps from some audience members. He responded to this by saying, \"What? He is a homosexual pedophile.\"[10]\n\nAnother uncomfortable moment occurred during the April 12, 1997, show (host Rob Lowe, musical guest The Spice Girls), wherein, during a Weekend Update story about Tabitha Soren, he accidentally coughed in the middle of a sentence and, live on the air, muttered, \"What the fuck was that?\" The audience applauded, and Macdonald laughed the error away (saying at one point \"My fare",

    "Description": "Subscribe if you own a doghouse\n\nNorman Gene Macdonald[i] (October 17, 1959[ii] – September 14, 2021) was a Canadian stand-up comedian, actor, and writer. His stand-up style was characterized by a slow, almost stuttering deadpan delivery and the use of folksy, old-fashioned turns of phrase.[1][2][3] He appeared in many films and was a regular guest on late-night talk shows, where he became best known for telling shaggy dog stories.[4]\n\nEarly in his career, Macdonald's first work on television included writing for such comedies as Roseanne and The Dennis Miller Show. In 1993, Macdonald was hired as a writer and cast member on Saturday Night Live (SNL), spending a total of five seasons on the series, which included anchoring the show's Weekend Update segment for three and a half seasons.[5] He was removed as host of SNL's Weekend Update in 1998, allegedly for relentlessly mocking O. J. Simpson during his murder trial, offending producer Don Ohlmeyer, of whom Simpson was a close friend.[6][7] After being fired from SNL, he wrote and starred in the 1998 film Dirty Work and headlined his own sitcom The Norm Show from 1999 to 2001. Macdonald was also a voice actor, and provided voice acting roles for Family Guy, Mike Tyson Mysteries, The Orville, and the Dr. Dolittle films.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2018, Macdonald hosted the talk shows Norm Macdonald Live (a video podcast) and Norm Macdonald Has a Show (a Netflix series), on which he interviewed comedians and other celebrities. In 2016, he authored Based on a True Story, a novel that presented a heavily fictionalized account of his life.[8] Macdonald died of leukemia in September 2021, a condition he had not publicly disclosed. He was 61 years old at the time.\n\nNorm Macdonald jew, Norm Macdonald making fun of jews, Norm Macdonald jew jokes",

    "Description": "Get The Brave Browser and get paid for browsing the web\nhttps://brave.com/var431\n\nHear the entire podcast of this Norm interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfhAaaeBPQ0\n\nIdentity politics are bullshit. Get a life progressives. \nNorman Gene \"Norm\" Macdonald is a Canadian stand-up comedian, writer, producer and actor. He is best known for his five seasons as a cast member on Saturday Night Live, which included anchoring Weekend Update for three years. Early in his career, he wrote for the sitcom Roseanne and made appearances on shows including The Drew Carey Show and NewsRadio. He starred in The Norm Show from 1999 to 2001. Comedy Central named him #83 on the five-part miniseries 100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time. He is noted as a favorite talk show guest of David Letterman, Howard Stern, Dennis Miller, and Conan O'Brien. His brother is Canadian journalist Neil Macdonald, of CBC News.[3][4]\n\nMacdonald was born in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada,[2] and raised in Ottawa, Ontario.[citation needed] Macdonald has a brother, Neil Macdonald, who is a journalist with the CBC.[4]\n\nCareer[edit]\nMacdonald's first performances in comedy were at stand-up at clubs in Ottawa. He appeared at the 1987 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal.[5]\n\nSaturday Night Live[edit]\nMacdonald joined the cast of NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) television program in 1993, where he performed impressions of Larry King, Burt Reynolds, David Letterman, Charles Kuralt and Bob Dole, among others. Following Kevin Nealon's departure from SNL, Macdonald anchored the segment Weekend Update. Chevy Chase, the first anchor of Weekend Update, has quipped that Macdonald was the \"best Weekend Update anchor since – well – Chevy Chase\".[6] Current Update anchor and head writer Colin Jost named Macdonald as a primary influence on Jost's own work behind the \"Update\" desk, explaining that Macdonald's tone was one that Jost grew up with in high school.[7]\n\nMacdonald's version of Weekend Update often included repeated references to prison rape, crack whores and the Germans' love of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. Macdonald would occasionally deliver a piece of news, then take out his personal compact tape recorder and leave a \"note to self\" relevant to what he just discussed. He commonly used Frank Stallone as a non sequitur punchline. Macdonald repeatedly ridiculed public figures such as Marion Barry, Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson. Throughout Simpson's trial for murder, Macdonald constantly pilloried the former football star, often heavily implying Simpson was guilty of the brutal slaying of his wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman. In the broadcast following Simpson's acquittal, Macdonald opened Weekend Update by saying: \"Well, it is finally official: murder is legal in the state of California.\"\n\nDuring the February 24, 1996, episode, Macdonald made a controversial joke about the sentencing of John Lotter, one of the two men who committed the notorious murder of Brandon Teena: \"In Falls City, Nebraska, John Lotter has been sentenced to death for attempting to kill three people in what prosecutors called a plot to silence a cross-dressing female who had accused him of rape. Now this might strike some viewers as harsh, but I believe everyone involved in this story deserved to die.\"[8][9]\n\nAfter the announcement that Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley planned to divorce, Macdonald joked about their irreconcilable differences on Weekend Update: \"She's more of a stay-at-home type, and he's more of a homosexual pedophile.\" He followed this up a few episodes later with a report about the singer's collapse and hospitalization. Referring to a report of how Jackson had decorated his hospital room with giant photographs of Shirley Temple, Macdonald remarked that viewers should not get the wrong idea, adding, \"Michael Jackson is a homosexual pedophile.\" The joke elicited audible gasps from some audience members. He responded to this by saying, \"What? He is a homosexual pedophile.\"[10]\n\nAnother uncomfortable moment occurred during the April 12, 1997, show (host Rob Lowe, musical guest The Spice Girls), wherein, during a Weekend Update story about Tabitha Soren, he accidentally coughed in the middle of a sentence and, live on the air, muttered, \"What the fuck was that?\" The audience applauded, and Macdonald laughed the error away (saying at one point \"My fare",

    "Description": "I'll never forget sitting a few rows from Norm Macdonald, almost exactly five years ago on September 22, 2016 at Sixth & I in Washington, D.C., when he read from his memoir \"Based on a True Story.\"  Now that we know he had cancer back then too, his reading of \"The Final Chapter\" might be the best way for us to understand what he went through, to celebrate his wit, melancholy, and kind heart.\n\nHe's sitting next to journalist Geoff Edgers, who wrote the best-ever piece on Norm, then one more \"final chapter\" at https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/norm-macdonald-appreciation/2021/09/15/315f6f52-15eb-11ec-b976-f4a43b740aeb_story.html\n\nHere, I edited and upscaled from a low-resolution copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy into 4K using Topaz Video Enhance AI, then I color graded using FilmConvert, and cleaned up the audio using iZotope RX 8 Advanced.  It felt important to get this right, shared here in a spirit of fair use and tribute.",

    "Description": "I put hours and hours of my heart and soul into this documentary, I hope you guys love it as much as I loved making it. It's one of my favorite videos I've ever made. I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. Thank you for watching. I said this on my original tribute, and I don't think I could say it any better than I did below...\n\nNorm Macdonald is undoubtedly one of the greatest comedians to ever walk the face of the planet. He is my absolute favorite comedian for so many reasons I couldn't  list them all if I tried. A few reasons that stand out are his absolutely masterful comedic timing and delivery, his intelligent and carefully-crafted observations, and his ability to be honest in a world full of deception. Norm Macdonald is undoubtedly a comedian's comedian. He was known in the mainstream for being on Billy Madison and Saturday Night Live, but aside from that his stand up and late night appearances really solidified why his comedic voice stood out from the rest. Louis C.K described Norm Macdonald as the closest comedian to Mark Twain because of his voice, and ability. Another thing I absolutely adored about Norm's comedy was the simplicity of his style. He would deliver things that everyone has observed before, but he'd do it in a humble manner that would catch you off-guard and make you laugh endlessly. There are often comedians that can be grouped together for a certain genre or style, but for Norm there is simply no comedian like him. He was truly an enigma because of his comedic voice, and there will never be another person like him. Norm left behind a legacy that no fan will ever forget. He's been an inspiration to many seasoned comedians and also young comedians like myself. I aspire to one day be able to do something similar to what this amazing man did on stage. The world of stand-up comedy is a slightly darker place without Norm Macdonald. I hope you guys enjoyed this tribute video. God Bless Norm Macdonald, may he rest in peace.\n\n\"It's one thing to make people laugh, it's another to make people smile.\"\n- Norm Macdonald\n\nContent of this Video:\n0:00 - Intro\n0:55 - Early Life and Career\n6:10 - Saturday Night Live\n13:15 - Movies and TV Shows\n17:26 - Stand-Up Comedy Specials\n22:41 - Comedian's Norm Macdonald Stories\n30:46 - Norm Macdonald Live\n38:04 - Late Night Shows\n44:16 - Norm's Big Secret\n47:11 - Closing Remarks\n.\nSources Used:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Macdonald\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005172/\nhttps://deadline.com/2021/09/norm-macdonald-dead-obituary-comedian-saturday-night-live-weekend-update-anchor-was-61-1234833212/sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjK9JOZoLKDAxUrkmoFHZGDBl0QFnoECEwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeadline.com%2F2021%2F09%2Fnorm-macdonald-dead-obituary-comedian-saturday-night-live-weekend-update-anchor-was-61-1234833212%2F&usg=AOvVaw32NxQkEXZMZzQxDQuDSri6&opi=89978449\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Norm-Macdonald",

The ensemble series stars MacFarlane as the ship’s Commanding Officer, Ed Mercer, and Adrianne Palicki (“Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Friday Night Lights”) as his ex-wife, Kelly Grayson, who’s assigned as his First Officer. Additional cast members include Penny Johnson Jerald as Dr. Claire Finn (“24,” “The Larry Sanders Show”), Scott Grimes as Gordon Malloy (“ER,” “Justified”), Peter Macon as Bortus (“Shameless,” “Bosch”), Halston Sage as Alara Kitan (“Neighbors,” “Goosebumps”), J. Lee as John LaMarr (FAMILY GUY, “The Cleveland Show”), Mark Jackson as Isaac (“That Royal Today”) and Chad L. Coleman as Klyden (“The Walking Dead,” “The Wire”).
