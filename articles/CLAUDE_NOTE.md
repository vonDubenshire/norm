# Note for Claude Code

This repository now includes a large article/link collection at:

- `articles/ARTICLE COMPILATION COLLECTION - MASSIVE NORM STORIES.txt`

Context from the repo owner:
- This file is intended to represent the large collection of links from Google Drive folder `MEMES > NORM MACDONALD`.
- Treat this as the source corpus for planning and building an articles page/ingestion workflow for additional Norm Macdonald content.

Next suggested actions for automation:
1. Classify links by domain/type.
2. De-duplicate and normalize URLs.
3. Generate article metadata stubs (title/source/topic/status).
4. Build or update an articles index page from this corpus.
